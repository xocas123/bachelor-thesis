I think it's become an abstracted thought form linking itself to my noospheric imprint, as it won't fucking go away.",True,NO,3.0,NO,FalseNegative,2,8,7,4,6,5,This text is likely a joke due to its absurd,"exaggerated tone and the sudden shift into pseudo-intellectual rambling (""abstracted thought form linking itself to my noospheric imprint"")","which is a common comedic device. The repetition of numbers and the frustrated outburst (""Fuck."") further suggest intentional humor rather than genuine distress. The juxtaposition of mundane math observations with grandiose","paranoid language creates a satirical or surreal effect.,The humor here relies on absurdity and the contrast between dry numerical observations and over-the-top existential dread, which may not resonate with everyone. Those who enjoy surreal, niche, or meta-comedy might find it funny, while others could perceive it as confusing or pretentious.,The misclassification (as not a joke) might stem from the lack of a clear punchline or the text's reliance on unconventional humor. The absurdist style and niche references (e.g., ""noospheric imprint"") could obscure the intent, making it harder to recognize as a joke without familiarity with similar comedic tropes.,The humor depends on context: familiarity with internet-era absurdism, numerology memes, or pseudoscientific jargon enhances the joke. Without this, the text might seem nonsensical or overly cryptic. The cultural reference to ""noospheric imprint"" (a niche term) adds a layer of irony, mocking pseudo-intellectualism."
"A double-barreled shotgun is a break-action shotgun with two parallel barrels, allowing two single shots to be fired in quick succession",False,NO,8.0,NO,LowConfidence,0,10,4,2,0,1,explanation_joke: The text is a factual description of a double-barreled shotgun,lacking any punchline,wordplay,"or absurdity typical of jokes. It is straightforward and informative, with no linguistic or contextual cues suggesting humor.  
explanation_funny: The text isn't funny because it doesn’t employ humor techniques like exaggeration, irony, or surprise. It aligns more with technical writing, which rarely elicits laughter unless intentionally subverted.  
explanation_misclassification: The low confidence score (8.0%) suggests the classifier correctly identified it as not a joke, but the ambiguity might stem from the rarity of such neutral texts in humor datasets, leading to cautious predictions.  
explanation_context: Context or cultural references play no role here, as the text is purely descriptive. Humor would require additional layers, such as a contrasting setup or cultural stereotype, which are absent."
"Ireland is a parliamentary, representative democratic republic and a member state of the European Union",False,NO,10.0,NO,LowConfidence,0,10,3,5,0,1,The text is a straightforward factual statement about Ireland's political system and EU membership,lacking any linguistic or contextual cues typical of jokes (e.g.,punchlines,"absurdity, or wordplay). It is not a joke because it is purely informational and devoid of humor-inducing elements.  
The text is not funny because it does not employ humor techniques (e.g., exaggeration, irony, or surprise) and aligns with neutral, factual discourse rather than comedic intent. Personal humor alignment is irrelevant here, as the content is not designed to amuse.  
If misclassified, it might be due to overinterpreting the dryness of the statement as deadpan humor or assuming sarcasm where none exists. However, the lack of subtext or incongruity makes such a reading unlikely.  
Context or cultural references play no role in humor here, as the statement is literal and culture-dependent only in its factual content (e.g., EU membership), not in its comedic potential."
[Request] What would happen if there was no nitrogen in air?,True,NO,3.0,NO,FalseNegative,0,10,4,2,3,1,The text is structured as a hypothetical scientific question,lacking typical joke elements like punchlines or absurdity. However,its dryness and absurd premise (removing nitrogen,"a major air component) could be a deadpan joke. The lack of explicit humor cues makes it ambiguous.,The humor, if intended, relies on the absurdity of the premise, which may not resonate with everyone. Personally, it feels more like a straightforward question than a joke, lacking cleverness or surprise.,Misclassification might occur due to the deadpan delivery, which can blur the line between serious and humorous. The low confidence (3%) suggests the model recognized its ambiguity but leaned toward literal interpretation.,If a joke, the humor derives from the absurdity of imagining air without nitrogen, a foundational element. Context matters—it could be funny among science enthusiasts who appreciate hyperbolic ""what ifs,"" but lacks broader cultural or contextual hooks."
With great power comes a huge electricity bill.,True,YES,9.0,YES,TruePositive,0,10,3,2,7,2,"The text is a joke because it subverts the expected serious meaning of the phrase ""With great power comes great responsibility"" by replacing it with a mundane","relatable twist (""huge electricity bill""). This unexpected shift creates humor through incongruity.  
It is funny because the punchline is relatable (high utility costs) and cleverly plays on a well-known quote","aligning with humor that rewards recognition and surprise.  
The low confidence score (9.0%) might stem from the joke's simplicity or lack of explicit punchline markers","making it seem more like a casual observation than a structured joke.  
The humor relies on familiarity with the original quote (often attributed to Spider-Man) and universal frustration over bills, requiring minimal cultural context but benefiting from pop-culture awareness."
"2=3-1 An engineer, a biologist and a mathematician are outside of an empty house. They observe two people walking into the house, and a while later three people exit the house. The engineer say,s ""Our initial assumption must be wrong!"" The biologist replies, ""It's obvious that they reproduced."" The mathematician says, ""now if one more person enters the house, it will be empty!""",True,YES,8.0,YES,TruePositive,0,9,5,2,3,2,This is a joke because it follows a classic setup-punchline structure,contrasting the logical interpretations of different professions in an absurd scenario. The humor relies on the mathematician's literal-mindedness,a common trope in joke-telling.,"The joke is funny because it subverts expectations with the mathematician's illogical conclusion, aligning with humor derived from intellectual absurdity. The contrast between the professions' reactions adds to the amusement.,The low confidence score (8.0%) might stem from the joke's subtlety or the classifier's difficulty recognizing profession-based humor. The true label (""joke"") confirms it was misclassified as non-joke due to these nuances.,The humor depends on understanding stereotypes about engineers, biologists, and mathematicians, but isn't culture-specific. The absurdity of the scenario (people appearing/disappearing) is universally recognizable, making it broadly accessible."
"A capitol is a building in which a legislature meets, including: Political authority of a territorial unit United States Capitol in Washington, D",False,NO,1.0,NO,TrueNegative,0,10,3,5,0,1,"explanation_joke: The text is a straightforward definition of a ""capitol"" and lists examples without any linguistic or contextual cues typical of jokes (e.g.",punchlines,absurdity,"or wordplay). It lacks the intent to amuse or provoke laughter.  
explanation_funny: The text is not funny because it is purely informational and lacks humor elements like irony, exaggeration, or surprise. Personal humor alignment would require subjective engagement, which this factual statement does not provide.  
explanation_misclassification: The classification as ""not a joke"" is correct, but the low confidence score (1.0%) might stem from the brevity or dryness of the text, which could be mistaken for deadpan humor in rare cases.  
explanation_context: Context or cultural references play no role in humor here, as the text is neutral and factual. The mention of the U.S. Capitol is culturally specific but not leveraged for comedic effect."
"(Meta) When people comment on some of these posts with “memesopdidntlike” or related stuff, why? I see it on almost every post and I think people need to cut the OP some slack as I think that a lot of those posts are valid for this sub. Do I have a bad view?",True,NO,3.0,,FalseNegative,0,8,4,3,2,3,The text is not a joke because it lacks typical joke structures like punchlines,absurdity,or intentional humor. It reads as a genuine meta-discussion about subreddit behavior,"with no linguistic or contextual cues indicating humor. The tone is more analytical than playful.  
It isn't funny because it doesn't aim to entertain or provoke laughter; it's a straightforward critique of a recurring Reddit phenomenon. Humor often relies on surprise or exaggeration, which this post lacks.  
The misclassification might stem from the meta-nature of the post, which could be mistaken for irony or self-referential humor. However, the earnest tone and lack of comedic intent suggest it was a false positive.  
Context plays a minimal role here, as the post is about a niche Reddit dynamic but doesn't leverage it for humor. Cultural references (e.g., subreddit names) are present but serve as discussion points, not comedic devices."
What do you get when you cross a horror film with a porno? I Know Who You Did Last Summer!,True,YES,8.0,YES,LowConfidence,4,5,6,7,3,3,"This is a joke because it combines wordplay (mixing a horror film title with a suggestive twist) and subverts expectations by merging two unrelated genres. The punchline relies on recognizing the original title (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"") and the absurdity of blending it with adult content.",It's funny because the unexpected mashup creates absurdity,and the wordplay is clever if you know the reference. However,"humor is subjective, and some might find it crude or unoriginal if they dislike genre-mixing jokes.,The low confidence (8%) suggests the classifier may have struggled due to the niche reference or ambiguity in tone. It might also misinterpret the adult theme as non-humorous or offensive.,The humor hinges on familiarity with the horror film title and the taboo of combining it with pornography. Without knowing the original movie, the joke falls flat, making it culturally dependent. The shock value of the contrast drives the comedy."
"Me explaining to my parents all the traumatic things I believed Me: * explains how I was hurt for many years by something I learned in church that I didn't question b/c I thought my parents agreed with it * My parents: ""How dare you assume we agree with the people we entrusted you with to teach you the inspired word of God! Why the hell would you think we agree with those nutjobs?!",True,NO,8.0,,LowConfidence,3,7,5,6,8,7,**explanation_joke**: This is a joke due to its exaggerated,ironic contrast between the speaker's traumatic experience and the parents' hyperbolic,"defensive reaction. The absurdity of the parents' outrage (""nutjobs"") over a reasonable assumption (trusting church teachings) creates comedic dissonance. The setup (serious confession) and punchline (irrational anger) follow a classic joke structure.  
**explanation_funny**: It may not be funny to some because the trauma theme clashes with humor expectations","or the sarcasm feels too biting. Others might find humor in the absurd parental logic or relatable critique of religious indoctrination, depending on personal alignment with dark/ironic comedy.  
**explanation_misclassification**: The low confidence (8%) suggests ambiguity—the trauma framing may overshadow humor cues. If labeled ""not a joke,"" the classifier possibly prioritized emotional weight over ironic intent or missed the hyperbolic sarcasm.  
**explanation_context**: The humor relies on cultural familiarity with religious upbringing and parental deflection. The punchline subverts expectations (parents blame the church, not themselves), playing on shared frustrations about authority figures in religious communities. Contextual knowledge of church dynamics amplifies the satire."
Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (c,False,NO,3.0,NO,TrueNegative,0,10,2,6,0,1,The text 'Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (c' is not a joke because it lacks any setup,punchline,or humorous intent. It appears to be an incomplete reference to the historical figure El Cid,"with no linguistic or contextual cues suggesting humor. The absence of wordplay, irony, or exaggeration further confirms its non-joke nature.  
The text is not funny because it is purely informational and lacks any elements of surprise, absurdity, or wit that typically elicit laughter. Personal humor alignment is irrelevant here, as the text does not attempt to be humorous.  
If misclassified, it might be due to the fragmentary nature of the text ('c') being misinterpreted as an attempt at abbreviation or coded humor. However, this is unlikely given the clear historical reference.  
Context or cultural references play no role in humor here, as the text is not a joke. The mention of Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar (El Cid) is culturally relevant to Spanish history but serves no comedic purpose."
What did Camus think about rejection? How does one deal with rejection?,True,NO,8.0,,FalseNegative,0,10,5,3,7,3,**explanation_joke**: The text is a joke because it juxtaposes the philosophical weight of Albert Camus (an existentialist thinker) with the mundane topic of rejection,"creating an absurd contrast. The humor lies in the unexpected pairing of highbrow and lowbrow concepts.  
**explanation_funny**: It may not be funny to some because the absurdist humor is subtle and relies on familiarity with Camus' work. Without that context","the punchline falls flat.  
**explanation_misclassification**: It might have been misclassified as ""not a joke"" due to its dry","intellectual tone, which could mask the absurdity if the reader overlooks the incongruity.  
**explanation_context**: The humor depends on recognizing Camus' association with existentialism and the irony of applying his deep philosophy to trivial modern problems like rejection. Without this cultural reference, the joke loses its edge."
I was just going to stay awake for my shift tonite. IDK who glued my eyes shut but they better hope I don't find em.,True,YES,8.0,YES,TruePositive,0,8,4,3,7,5,"This is a joke because it uses hyperbole (""glued my eyes shut"") and a playful threat (""they better hope I don't find em"") to create absurdity","which is a common joke structure. The contrast between the mundane (staying awake for a shift) and the exaggerated (someone gluing their eyes shut) signals humor.  

It’s funny because the absurdity of someone literally gluing another person’s eyes shut is unexpected and ridiculous","aligning with slapstick or surreal humor. The exaggerated frustration of the speaker adds to the comedic effect.  

If misclassified","it might be due to the low confidence score (8%), suggesting the model struggled with the informal tone (""tonite,"" ""IDK"") or the hyperbolic nature of the threat, which could be misinterpreted as genuine annoyance.  

The humor relies on universal absurdity rather than specific cultural references, but the informal language and shift-work context might resonate more with certain audiences (e.g., younger or night-shift workers). The sarcasm (""they better hope I don’t find em"") adds a layer of playful exaggeration."
"Hradčany (; ), the Castle District, is the district of the city of Prague, Czech Republic surrounding Prague Castle",False,NO,1.0,NO,LowConfidence,0,10,3,6,0,1,explanation_joke: The text is a straightforward factual description of Hradčany,lacking any linguistic or contextual cues typical of jokes (e.g.,punchlines,"absurdity, or wordplay). It serves an informative purpose rather than a humorous one.  
explanation_funny: The text is not funny because it lacks comedic elements such as irony, exaggeration, or surprise. It aligns with a neutral, educational tone, which doesn’t resonate with personal humor preferences.  
explanation_misclassification: Misclassification is unlikely here, as the text is clearly not a joke. If it were misclassified, it might be due to an overly sensitive model or confusion with similarly structured but humorous texts.

The absurdity and plea for validation (""trust me"") mimic meme or copypasta humor.  
**explanation_funny**: It may not be funny to some because the humor relies on over-the-top absurdity and internet slang, which can feel forced or unoriginal if the reader doesn't align with that style. Personal humor preferences play a role here.  
**explanation_misclassification**: The low confidence (3%) suggests uncertainty, possibly due to the lack of explicit punchlines or reliance on tone, which can be ambiguous in text. The earnest-seeming delivery might mask the joke intent.  
**explanation_context**: The humor depends on internet culture's love for absurd, hyperbolic stories and the expectation of playful trolling. Without familiarity with such tropes, the joke might fall flat or seem genuine."

My personal humor preference leans toward more absurd or clever wordplay."",""The low confidence (8%) suggests the classifier struggled with the slang or pun, possibly due to limited training data on such linguistic quirks or ambiguity in the punchline's clarity."",""The humor depends on understanding 'take an L' as slang for losing, which is culturally specific to certain English-speaking communities.
